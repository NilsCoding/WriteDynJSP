# WriteDynJSPThis is a sample project for a servlet which dynamically deploys JSP files from database to web application.It uses a container-provided database connection to select the JSP content, check modification dates, writes the JSP to disk and then forwards to that JSP.For configuration details see sample `context.xml` and `web.xml` in this project.# NoticeThis is a proof-of-concept application which is not intended for production usage.It is also not fully tested with different web-application servers and configurations.Feel free to fork and extend it.
